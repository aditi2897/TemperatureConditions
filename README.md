# TemperatureConditions
## The project has two files: Climate and ClimateMain.
#### The ClimateMain asks the user to input the climate type: HOT/COLD(I have kept it case insensitive).
#### There are two HashMaps HOT and COLD to maintain the data. According to the users input the apprpriate hashmap and user input is passed to the function "climateVerification()" in Climate class.
#### The assignData() basically assigns data to hashmap which is predefined and cannot be changed. 
#### After validating and evaluating the input from the user, A string value is returned by the method as per the given example below:
#### Input: HOT 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 7
#### Output: Removing PJs, shorts, t-shirt, sun visor, sandals, leaving house

#### The program takes O(n) time complexity
